    Hello!  Iâ€™m Isabella Qiu, a sophomore at Dublin High School. I am currently enrolled in the Principles of Engineering class, and I hope to enter a STEM field in the future.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon entering high school, I found an interest in robotics, and I was keen on joining the robotics club at Dublin High.  By doing so, I am lucky enough to be surrounded by many knowledgeable and passionate students who are share many of my interests.  I realized that I have been able to learn from them and pick up many useful skills in these past two years, whether that may be teamwork and collaboration or planning designs and cutting metal.  Additionally, I have uncovered many other interests through school projects and outside-of-school activities, the most notable one being web design.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for future plans and career paths, I could definitely see myself delving deeper into web design, but that's not something I would want to make my full time job.  Instead, I want to focus on trying new things in high school and perhaps then I will find where my true passions lie.
