    <h2>December 2020</h2>

      <p>We thought that pouring milk into cereal was too boring, so we created a compound machine for a longer, more fun, and unnecessarily complicated way to pour milk into cereal.  In order to arrive at a final mechanism, we had to follow through with PLTW's Design Process, and our prototype needed to include at least 3 mechanisms per person in our team, as well as applied effort force that may only be provided by a single human input.  All our materials were also limited to be common household items. Given the restraints and time window we had to complete this project, my teammates and I had to meticulously plan our time and record our own individual modifications and design processes. We found that some had more luck than others when building, but we all went through many rounds of design and testing to arrive at a final compound machine.</p>

        <h2>October 2019</h2>
        <div class="scratchText" class="col-md-12">
          <p>At some points, developing our app felt like spreading perfectly softened butter on toast.  At other times, the development process was much like burnt toast, but I think every team will go through these kinds of moments throughout their development process.  For us, the tutorial code portion of the app was where we got tangled up in the most.  The instructions were clear to a good extent when reading through it, but when attempting to execute what is shown in the tutorial, we quickly ran into some problems, whether that was not finding a block, mistyping something when renaming components, or getting mixed up between the component names we chose compared to the ones shown in the tutorial.  However, once we got past this part of our development process, the rest was mainly built on our creativity and brainstorming ideas.  The feedback that we got towards the beginning of the project, although we were not completely done with our tutorial code yet, gave us another perspective on what people might want to see us play around with in Colored Dots.  Our ideas at the time were small and very “inside-the-box.”  However, talking with another group made us reassess our ideas, taking into account other ideas that were more bold, like creating sprites and stickers to go onto the canvas.</p>

          <p>Good communication was  crucial to making this project, especially since a lot of the time you’ll be working on programming is during the weekend, when you can’t see  your partner face to face.  I learned that nobody can read your mind and you have to be proactive and open with your partner by contacting them.  In our emails, we both assessed our current progress and told the other if we would have any free time to work on specific parts of the project.  Overall, I think we had great communication, which helped push our project to be the best it could be.  It was important that we were open to any ideas in the first stages of making this project, and I think that was what enabled us to do something really creative that, if asked at the very beginning of the project, we’d never thought we’d do.</p>
